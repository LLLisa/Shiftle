5 words vert, 5 words horiz, middle square revealed by default (can toggle for
extra challenge) words "rotate" vert and horiz to get to disred word block when
a 5 letter word that is in the puzzle is made, highlighted?

- or just a 5 letter word on the list? - I think this one, don't want it to be
  too easy
